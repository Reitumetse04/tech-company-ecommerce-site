# E-Commerce Website for a Tech Company

## Overview
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built for a small tech company.
Varsity Store Technologies is a modern, front-end e-commerce website designed to showcase ICT products and professional services.
This project was built to demonstrate my practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on clean UI design, responsiveness, and real-world user interactions.

The website simulates a real online store experience, including product catalogs, a shopping cart system, and service pages tailored for a technology consulting business.
